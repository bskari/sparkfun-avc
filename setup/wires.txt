The Raspberry Pi A+ has 40 pins. Numbering starts opposite from the side where
the USB port is, and starts at the inside of the board, then goes to the
outside, then to the right.

The GPS module has 8 pins. Numbering starts from the bottom of the module as
viewed from the top with the text label right side up.
1 - RXD, UART input, 3.3V LVTTL
2 - TXD, UART output, 3.3V LVTTL
3 - GND
4 - VDD, main power 3V~3.6V
5 - VBAT, backup supply voltage for RTC and SRAM, can be tied directly to VDD
6 - P1PPS, 1 pulse per second time mark output
7 - BOOT_SEL, connect to VDD for normal use, GND for loading firmware
8 - RSTN, active low reset pin, leave unconnected

Steering servo:
Black is ground, connected to pin 6.
Red is 5V DC power, connected to pin 2.
White/yellow is signal, connected to GPIO 4, pin 7.

Electronic speed control:
Black is ground, connected to pin 9.
Red is 5V DC power, connected to pin 4.
White/yellow is signal, connected to GPIO 18, pin 12.

Button:
One wire connects to pin 1, 3V3 DC.
One wire connects to GPIO 17, pin pin 11.

GPS:
1 - RXD, connect to UART TXD, GPIO 14, pin 8.
